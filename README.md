# Fundamentals First Solutions Repository

Welcome to your Code Solutions Repository for Fundamentals First!

For this program, you'll be using this repository to store all of your code changes in once place!

Throughout the 4 weeks of the program, you'll be recieving compressed `.zip` or `.tar.gz` files that contains either an assignment, or a workshop starter. Simply expand those files into this repository, and you'll be able to begin working!

## Git and GitHub

For this program, we'll be using lots of Git and GitHub to keep track of all your assignments, as well as receive feedback from your instructors. If you're not already familiar with Git and GitHub, I have a few introductory videos linked below so that you can get an idea of what these are, and what they do.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a very popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is really just a really fancy text editor with a lot of tools to help programmers.

Generally, developers like to personalize their VS Code editors to really make it their own, so feel free to do so yourself, as well. For now, VS Code is set up so that you have all the settings and extensions for the program, so this is an optional step.

Here's a quick guide to get you started: [Set up Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)

## Get Ready!

With all that being said, we'll go over more specifics on how assignments work, how submissions work, and how feedback is given on our first Workshop date!

For now, you can check out the "\_\_sample\_\_" directory to see a sample of what files a typical web application would contain. The code inside is pretty basic, but we'll go over this all on our first workshop date, as well!
