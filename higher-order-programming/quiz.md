# Higher Order Programming Quiz

1. What does higher order programming (or functional programming) involve?
   It involves treating functions as "first-class citizens"
   Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned form functions, and stored in data structures. They emphasize the use of functions to solve problems and build software, which can lead to more modular, reusable, and easier to understand code.
2. What is a **callback function**?
   Callback functions are passed into another function as an argument, which are then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. They're "called back" by the outer function at a ceratin point of execution.
3. What is one advantage of using `forEach` over a normal `for` loop when iterating over an array?
   forEach has the advantage of (while iterating over a loop) of simplicity, readability, eliminating off-by-one errors, providing clearer intent, and automatically handling array lengths.
4. What is it called when we assign a function to a variable declared using `let`?
   When we assign a function to a variable declared using 'let', we call it a function expression
