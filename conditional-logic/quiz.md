#### Truth Table Exercise

Fill in the missing values in this truth table by typing the expected boolean value to the corresponding number below:

> **Note:** Operations in parentheses have priority, so they should be evaluated first, and then the final result should come from combining the inner results.

| p       | q       | !p      | p OR q | p AND q | (!p) OR (p AND q) |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------- |
| `true`  | `true`  | **1**   | `true` | `true`  | **5**             |
| `true`  | `false` | `false` | **2**  | `false` | **6**             |
| `false` | `true`  | `true`  | `true` | **4**   | **7**             |
| `false` | `false` | `true`  | **3**  | `false` | **8**             |
