# Objects Quiz

1. Describe the syntax (structure) of object literals in JavaScript. How do we declare them?
   Object literals are declared using curly braces {} and contain key-value pairs separated by commas
   The keys (property names) can be strings or valid identifiers, and the values can be any valid JavaScript expression, including other objects or functions.

2. What is the primary purpose of objects in JavaScript?
   The primary purpose of objects in JavaScript is to:

-   Group related data and functionality together
-   Create reusable and organized code structures
-   Represent real-world entities or concepts in code
-   Provide a way to store and access collections of data efficiently

3. What are object properties?
   Object properties are named values associated with an object.
   They can hold any valid JavaScript data type, including primitive values, functions (methods), or other objects.
   Properties define the characteristics and behaviors of an object.

4. What are the two ways to access, update, or add an object property? What's the difference between the two?
   Dot notation
   // objectName.propertyName

Bracket notation
// objectName["propertyName"]

The main differences between the two are:
Dot notation is more concise and commonly used for known, valid identifier property names.
Bracket notation allows for dynamic property names, use of special characters in property names, and accessing properties using variables
Both methods can be used interchangeably in most cases, but bracket notation provides more flexibility when working with dynamic or computed property names.
