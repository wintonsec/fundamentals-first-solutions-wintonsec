# Loops and Iteration Quiz

1. What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in `for` loops?
   condition is expressed in a for loop and is evaluated before each iteration of the loop, determining whether the loop should continue running or if it should terminate.

Condition = true ; this means the loop executes
condition = false ; this loop stops, and control is passed to the statement following the loop 2. When is the first expression in a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) run?
initialization is run once before the loop starts, initializing one or more loop counters or variables used within the loop 3. When is the second expression in a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
the condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop 4. When is the third expression in a `for` loop (known as the **incrementing statement**) run?
the third expression is after the iteration of the loop body, but before teh next evaluation of the condition. This usually updates the loop counter 5. What is the purpose of the **incrementing statement** in a `for` loop?
Incrementing statements are used to update the loop counter or variable after each iteration, ensuring that the loop progresses towards the termination condition, preventing infinite loops 6. What is the process of looping over arrays called?
looping over arrays is called an iteration 7. When looping over arrays, what does the loop variable `i` represent?
the variable 'i' represents the index of the current element in the array, starting from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration using array[i]

## Tips:

1. How to write `Code Examples` in markdown

**for JS**:

```javascript
let data = "Howdy";
```

**for HTML**:

```html
<div>
    <p>This is text content</p>
</div>
```

**for CSS**:

```css
div {
    width: 100%;
